Better data serialization for registering mailboxes
-> ideally this will allow for the serialization of their uuid, name, dimension, location, etc in one entry

Hopper handling
-> received mail can be hoppered out from the bottom
-> automatically inserting stamps to stamp slot requires that the stamp is addressed
-> automatically inserting unaddressed stamps defaults to outgoing slot
-> automatically inserting anything else goes to the outgoing slot
-> crafting recipe for stamp address duplication at the Crafter block

Redstone handling
-> checkbox on the mailbox gui: send pulse when mail sent
-> checkbox on the mailbox gui: send pulse when mail received

Renaming the mailbox
-> requires text editing field on the mailbox gui
-> rename_mailbox packet
-> renaming a mailbox should update the display name in the mailbox list for any player who has the list open

Stamp GUI
-> display gui when receiving packet
-> pagination and display of registered mailboxes
-> mailboxes filtered by dimension
-> selection visibly highlights a choice
-> confirming choice saves or overwrites stamp nbt data
-> filter list of mailboxes with text input field and search button
-> clear button to reset to blank stamp

Stamp polish
-> change default item texture to be blank stamp
-> item texture adds green lines when stamp is addressed
-> custom tooltip displaying chosen address and/or instructions

Mailbox polish
-> animation for opening mailbox / door hinge
-> flapping wings animation that plays when mail is received
-> particle effects when active
-> daylight sensor texture should change depending on day/night cycle
-> sound effects for open/close
-> sound effects for send/receive
-> immediately prompt to rename the mailbox when placing it
-> mailbox eyes should glow in the dark

Phantom Courier
-> mob spawning
-> mob pathing from sky to mailbox
-> mail delivery when courier arrives successfully
-> mail placed into pending delivery state / server storage when courier despawns (after flying back up into the sky)
-> handling situations where the courier must path to the mailbox instead of descending directly downward
-> handle scenario where the mailbox is destroyed with the courier enroute
-> handle scenario where mailbox contents are stolen with the courier enroute
-> animations
-> particles
-> sound effects
-> display or hide parcel undercarriage depending on whether or not the courier has cargo
-> automatic despawn if pathing fails
-> handle situation where courier gets stuck in a boat, minecart, etc
-> gracefully handle situation involving couriers and leads
-> gracefully handle (ignore) nether portals and end portals
-> couriers that die should drop their mail (and the stamp) and unregister the package
-> determine whether or not inclimate weather should have an impact on deliveries
-> gracefully despawn if dawn arrives while the courier is active
-> gracefully handle courier struck by lightning
-> handle courier repelled by cats
-> gracefully handle finding an appropriate mailbox when spawned via egg

Overnight Delivery
-> tick the send-and-receive funcs on valid / loaded mailboxes if all players on a server sleep

Pending Mail storage / serialization / etc

Consuming the stamp when mail is sent

Return to Sender
-> Handle situation where unsent outgoing stamp is addressed to invalid mailbox by immediately returning to sender
-> Handle situation where pending mail is returned to sender due to destroyed mailbox, etc
-> Handle situation where mail is sent to yourself gracefully
-> Handle lost-and-found situation where mail cannot be received or returned

Implementation of some item used to make stamps other than nametags

Returning mail that can't be delivered due to destroyed recipient mailbox

Handling for situations where sender mailbox and receiver mailbox are both destroyed and mail cannot be delivered

Detect other installed mods (if Ars Nouveau is installed, occasionally spawn Starbuncle courier, etc)

Occasionally deliver spam mail to a loaded mailbox
